# Walking through `code`

1. We need to understand our data. It needs to be cleaned, and we need to be able to visualize how our data relates. 
Information regarding that can be found here 
[`jn_00_eda_train_and_spray.ipynb`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mudassirmayet/rrm/blob/master/completed/code/jn_00_eda_train_and_spray.ipynb) for our `train` and `spray` data.
Our EDA for our `weather` data can be found here
[`jn_01_eda_weather.ipynb`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mudassirmayet/rrm/blob/master/completed/code/jn_01_eda_weather.ipynb) for our `train` and `spray` data.
2. Our first two round at running models on our data can be found here. They are not substantial results, but allow us to get a better understanding
of which direction we should go forward in. This can be found here
[`jn_02_initial_models.ipynb`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mudassirmayet/rrm/blob/master/completed/code/jn_02_initial_models.ipynb)
3. We realized that these were very terrible results and needed to do some research so we looked into outside works and papers to mimic their
work. We decided to show and include [`jn_03_beating_the_benchmark.ipynb`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mudassirmayet/rrm/blob/master/completed/code/jn_03_beating_the_benchmark.ipynb).
4. Finally, we incorporated everything we've learned, tried a few final techniques, and resulted with our final modelling notebook here
[`jn_04_random_rolls.ipynb`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mudassirmayet/rrm/blob/master/completed/code/jn_04_random_rolls.ipynb).
